## Introduction

Based off https://github.com/carsguide/lumen-horizon and `Laravel\Horizon` - upgraded to Lumen Horizon 5 with Lumen 8.0 support

Tested with **Lumen 8.0**

## Installation

The installation is almost the same as original package.

Note that the package namespace remains `Laravel\Horizon`, so don't install it along with original one to avoid conflicts.

1. Composer dependency manager:

```bash
    composer require coffeesouffle/lumen-horizon "^5.0"
```

Alternatively, add the dependency directly to your composer.json file:

```
    "require": {
        "coffeesouffle/lumen-horizon": "^5.0"
    }
```

2. Publish `horizon.php` file to the config folder:

```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=horizon-config
```

or, as suggested in the official package docs:

```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Horizon\HorizonServiceProvider"
```


## Official Documentation

Documentation for Horizon can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/master/horizon).
